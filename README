Installation Guide

Pre-requisites:
Tomcat 6.0.35 or greater installed.
Oracle database to connect to.
JDK 6 Update 45 or greater installed.
Using Linux OS version 3.2.0-70-generic or greater.

Download:
If you haven't already, download a zip file of the repository from:
https://github.com/ulviibrahimov/CMPUT391F

Save this file and then extract it to your Tomcat's /wepapps/ directory.  You should now have a directory that looks like this (not all files listed):
-webapps
	-CMPUT391F
		-help
		-MEAT-INF
		-Sources
		-WEB-INF

You may need to rename the extracted folder to "CMPUT391F" or the webapp will not work.

Configure:
Now you should configure your connection.  This is done by editing the connectionConfig.txt file found in the root directory of CMPUT391F.

Here you should replace the three lines after "START" with the database connection string, followed a newline, username, newline, and password for the database.  Be careful not change any other line or the next step may fail!

Setup database and compile:
Just run the makefile that is provided in the root directory of CMPUT391F.

Congratulations:
You should be done!  Try visiting the wepapp!
(You have been provided with a default admin account, username:'admin', password:'secret')
